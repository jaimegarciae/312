Q: What is amortized doubling?

A: Double the array whenever it is full so that you can add more elements next time. You'll keep a seperate array capacity and length so that you know when it's full.


Q; How do we print?

A: You have to use cout. Use the c_str() function of the string class to get a string that cout can print properly.


Q: Which files do we turn in?

A: Turn in anything you edited. You can zip them up or sumbit them individually, either is fine.



These were already in the doc, but they should be included again.

No customers will attempt to buy negative numbers of anything.
Don't add customers who ask for 0 items of anything. Don't respond to them either.
If a customer asks for more than the available inventory, don't add them if they are not already a customer. You must however, respond to them with "Sorry â€¦".
Use the plural forms of Diapers, Rattles, and Bottles even when talking of 1 of them.
Use only cout (instead of printf).
